ðŸ’¡ Question: Find the Difference Between Two Integers Using a Class in C++

Problem Statement:

Create a C++ program using a class Number to read two integers from the user and display the absolute difference between them.


---

ðŸ”§ Class Specification:

Define a class Number with the following members:

Private Data Members:

int n1 â€“ to store the first number

int n2 â€“ to store the second number


Public Member Functions:

1. void readInput() â€“
Prompts the user to input values for n1 and n2.


2. void diff(Number& o) â€“
Computes and displays the absolute difference between the two numbers stored in the object o.
Use the condition:

If n1 > n2, difference = n1 - n2

Else, difference = n2 - n1





---

ðŸ§ª Sample Input/Output:

Enter n1: 25
Enter n2: 40

The difference two integers is: 15


---

ðŸ“Œ Notes:

The function diff() takes the object by reference and accesses its own private members.

This exercise helps practice working with classes, objects, function parameters, and basic arithmetic in C++.



---

Would you like me to enhance this into a multi-object version or add validation (e.g., no negative inputs)?
