/*
The name of this problem is:

"Create a Batsman Class to Calculate and Display Batting Average"


---

üìå Alternative Titles:

"Batsman Statistics Management Using C++ Classes"

"Program to Compute Batting Average of a Cricketer"

"OOP-Based Cricket Batsman Record with Average Calculation"



---

‚úÖ Problem Overview:

You are required to create a batsman class that:

1. Takes input for:

Batsman code

Name

Number of innings

Number of not-outs

Total runs



2. Calculates the batting average using:



\text{batAvg} = \frac{\text{runs}}{\text{innings} - \text{notouts}}


---

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:

You are using static_cast<float> for accurate division ‚Äî this is good practice!

The calAvg() method is made private, ensuring that average calculation is encapsulated.



---

Would you like a version that handles multiple batsmen or adds validation (like checking for division by zero)?
