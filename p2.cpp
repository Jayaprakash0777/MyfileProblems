/*
The name of this problem is:
"Replace Each Array Element with Product of Its Adjacent Elements"


---

üîç Problem Description (based on your code):

You are given an array of n integers. The task is to alter each element of the array such that:

For the first element (i == 0), it is replaced by the product of the first and second elements.

For the last element (i == n - 1), it is replaced by the product of the last and second-last elements.

For all other elements (0 < i < n - 1), it is replaced by the product of its previous and next elements.



---

‚ö†Ô∏è Bug Notice:

There's a mistake in this line:

if(i=n-1)

This should be:

if(i == n-1)

Because = is an assignment operator, and == is the equality comparison operator.
